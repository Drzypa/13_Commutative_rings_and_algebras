\begin{document}
A {\em Marot ring} is any commutative ring with non-zero unity, where every regular ideal may be generated by regular elements.

\textbf{Note.}\, $\mathbb{Z}_m$ is trivially a Marot ring (see the entry ``\PMlinkname{regular ideal}{RegularIdeal}''); an integral domain is another example because it has no zero divisors. % what would be a non-trivial Marot ring?
