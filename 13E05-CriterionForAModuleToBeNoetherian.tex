\begin{theorem}
A module is noetherian if and only if all of its submodules and 
\PMlinkname{quotients}{QuotientModule} are noetherian.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}  Suppose $M$ is Noetherian (over a ring $R$), and $N\subseteq M$ a submodule.  Since any submodule of $M$ is finitely generated, any submodule of $N$, being a submodule of $M$, is finitely generated as well.  Next, if $A/N$ is a submodule of $M/N$, and if $a_1,\ldots, a_n$ is a generating set for $A\subseteq M$, then $a_1+N,\ldots,a_n+N$ is a generating set for $A/N$.  Conversely, if every submodule of $M$ is Noetherian, then $M$, being a submodule itself, must be Noetherian.
\end{proof}

A weaker form of the converse is the following:
\begin{theorem}
If $N\subseteq M$ is a submodule of $M$ such that $N$ and $M/N$ are Noetherian, then $M$ is Noetherian.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}  Suppose $A_1\subseteq A_2\subseteq \cdots $ is an ascending chain of submodules of $M$.  Let $B_i=A_i\cap N$, then $B_1\subseteq B_2\subseteq \cdots $ is an ascending chain of submodules of $N$.  Since $N$ is Noetherian, the chain terminates at, say $B_n$.  Let $C_i=(A_i+N)/N$, then $C_1\subseteq C_2\subseteq \cdots $ is an ascending chain of submodules of $M/N$.  Since $M/N$ is Noetherian, the chain stops at, say $C_m$.  Let $k=\max(m,n)$.  Then we have $B_k=B_{k+1}$ and $C_k=C_{k+1}$.  We want to show that $A_k=A_{k+1}$.  Since $A_k\subseteq A_{k+1}$, we need the other inclusion.  Pick $a\in A_{k+1}$.  Then $a+N=b+N$, where $b\in A_k$.  This means that $a-b\in N$.  But $b\in A_{k+1}$ as well, so $a-b\in N\cap A_{k+1}$.  Since $N\cap A_k =N\cap A_{k+1}$, this means that $a-b\in A_k$ or $a\in A_k$.
\end{proof}
