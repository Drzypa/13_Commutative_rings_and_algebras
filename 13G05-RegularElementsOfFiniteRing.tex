\begin{thmplain}
\, If the finite ring $R$ has regular elements, then it has a unity.\, All regular elements of $R$ form a group under the ring multiplication and with identity element the unity of $R$.\, Thus the regular elements are exactly the units of the ring; the rest of the elements are the zero and the zero divisors.
\end{thmplain}

{\em Proof.}\, Obviously, the set of the regular elements is non-empty and closed under the multiplication.\, Let's think the multiplication table of this set.\, It is a finite \PMlinkescapetext{square where every row only contains} distinct elements (any equation\, $ax = ay$\, reduces to\, $x = y$).\, Hence, for every regular element $a$, the square $a^2$ determines another $a'$ such that\, $a^2a' = a$.\, This implies\, $a'(a^2a')(aa') = a'a(aa')$,\, i.e.\, $(a'a)(aa')^2 = (a'a)(aa')$,\, and since $a'a$ is \PMlinkname{regular}{ZeroDivisor},\, we obtain that\, $(aa')^2 = aa'$.\, So $aa'$ is idempotent, and because it also is \PMlinkescapetext{regular}, it must be the \PMlinkname{unity of the ring}{Unity}:\, $aa' = 1$.\, Thus we see that $R$ has a unity which is a regular element and that $a$ has a multiplicative inverse $a'$, also regular.\, Consequently the regular elements form a group.
