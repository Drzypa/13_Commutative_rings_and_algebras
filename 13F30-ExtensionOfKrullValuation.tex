The Krull valuation\, $|\cdot|_K$\, of the field $K$ is called the {\em \PMlinkescapetext{extension} of the Krull valuation} \,$|\cdot|_k$\, of the field $k$, if $k$ is a subfield of $K$ and\, $|\cdot|_k$\, is the restriction of\, $|\cdot|_K$\, on $k$.

\begin{thmplain}\, The trivial valuation is the only \PMlinkescapetext{extension} of the trivial valuation of $k$ to an algebraic extension field $K$ of $k$.
\end{thmplain}

{\em Proof.}\, Let's denote by\, $|\cdot|$\, the trivial valuation of $k$ and also its arbitrary Krull \PMlinkescapetext{extension valuation} to $K$.\, Suppose that there is an element $\alpha$ of $K$ such that\, $|\alpha| > 1$.\, This element satisfies an algebraic equation
     $$\alpha^n+a_1\alpha^{n-1}+...+a_n = 0,$$
where\, $a_1,\, ..., \,a_n\, \in k$.\, Since\, $|a_j| \leqq 1$\, for all $j$'s, we get the impossibility
 $$0 = |\alpha^n+a_1\alpha^{n-1}+...+a_n| =
\max\{|\alpha|^n,\,|a_1|\!\cdot|\!\alpha|^{n-1},\, ...,\, |a_n|\} = 
|\alpha|^n > 1$$
(cf. the sharpening of the ultrametric triangle inequality).\, Therefore we must have\, $|\xi| \leqq 1$\, for all\, $\xi\in K$, \,and because the condition\, $0 < |\xi| < 1$\, would imply that\, $|\xi^{-1}| > 1$,\, we see that 
              $$|\xi| = 1 \quad \forall\xi\in K\!\setminus\!\{0\},$$
which \PMlinkescapetext{means} that the valuation is trivial.

The proof (in [1]) of the next ``extension theorem'' is much longer (one must utilize the extension theorem concerning the place of field):

\begin{thmplain}\, Every Krull valuation of a field $k$ can be extended to a Krull valuation of any \PMlinkescapetext{extension} field of $k$.
\end{thmplain}
