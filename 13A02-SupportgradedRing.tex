\begin{document}
Let $S$ be a groupoid (semigroup, group) and suppose $R = \bigoplus_{s \in S}
R_{s}$ is an $S$- graded ring.

We define the {\em
support} of $r$ to be the set $\supp(r) = \{ s \in S \mid
r_{s} \neq 0 \}$. We can extend this definition to $\supp(R) = \bigcup \supp%%(r) = \{ s \in S \st
R_{s} \neq 0 \}$.  If $\supp(R)$ is a finite set then we say that the ring $R$ has {\em finite
support}.
