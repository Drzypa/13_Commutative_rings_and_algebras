\textbf{Theorem.}\, If $K$ is a field, then the ring $K[[X]]$ of formal power series is a discrete valuation ring with 
$(X)$ its unique maximal ideal.\\

\emph{Proof.}\, We show first that an arbitrary ideal $I$ of $K[[X]]$ is a principal ideal.\, If\, 
$I = (0)$,\, the thing is ready.\, Therefore, let\, $I \neq (0)$.\, Take an element 
$$f(X) \;:=\; \sum_{i=0}^\infty a_iX^i$$
of $I$ such that it has the least possible amount of successive zero coefficients in its beginning; let its first non-zero coefficient be $a_k$.\, Then
$$f(X) \;=\; X^k(a_k\!+\!a_{k+1}X\!+\ldots).$$
Here we have in the parentheses an invertible formal power series $g(X)$, whence get the equation
$$X^k \;=\; f(X)[g(X)]^{-1}$$
implying\, $X^k \in I$\, and consequently\, $(X^k) \subseteq I$.\\
For obtaining the reverse inclusion, suppose that
$$h(X) \;:=\; b_nX^n\!+\!b_{n+1}X^{n+1}\!+\ldots$$
is an arbitrary nonzero element of $I$ where\, $b_n \neq 0$.\, Because\, $n \ge k$,\, we may write
$$h(X) \;=\; X^k(b_nX^{n-k}\!+\!b_{n+1}X^{n-k+1}\!+\ldots).$$
This equation says that\, $h(X) \in (X^k)$,\, whence\, $I \subseteq (X^k)$.\\
Thus we have seen that $I$ is the principal ideal $(X^k)$, so that $K[[X]]$ is a principal ideal domain.\\
Now, all ideals of the ring $K[[X]]$ form apparently the strictly descending chain
$$(X) \;\supset\; (X^2) \;\supset\; (X^3) \;\supset\; \ldots \;\supset\; (0),$$
whence the ring has the unique maximal ideal $(X)$.\, A principal ideal domain with only one maximal ideal is a discrete valuation ring.
