\textbf{Theorem.}\, If a polynomial ring $D[X]$ over an integral domain $D$ is a principal ideal domain, then coefficient ring $D$ is a field. (Cf. the corollary 4 in the entry polynomial ring over a field.)\\

{\em Proof.}\, Let $a$ be any non-zero element of $D$.\, Then the ideal \,$(a,\,X)$\, of $D[X]$ is a principal ideal $(f(X))$ with $f(X)$ a \PMlinkname{non-zero polynomial}{ZeroPolynomial2}.\, Therefore, 
$$a \;=\; f(X)g(X), \quad X \;=\; f(X)h(X)$$
with $g(X)$ and $h(X)$ certain polynomials in $D[X]$.\, From these equations one infers that $f(X)$ is a \PMlinkescapetext{constant} polynomial $c$ and $h(X)$ is a first degree polynomial $b_0\!+\!b_1X$ ($b_1 \neq 0$).\, Thus we obtain the equation
$$cb_0+cb_1X \;=\; X,$$
which shows that $cb_1$ is the unity 1 of $D$.\, Thus\, $c = f(X)$\, is a unit of $D$, whence
$$(a,\,X) \;=\; (f(X)) \;=\; (1) \;=\; D[X].$$
So we can write 
$$1 \;=\; a\!\cdot\!u(X)+X\!\cdot\!v(X),$$
where\, $u(X),\,v(X) \in D[X]$.\, This equation cannot be possible without that $a$ times the constant term of $u(X)$ is the unity.\, Accordingly, $a$ has a multiplicative inverse in $D$.\, Because $a$ was arbitrary non-zero elenent of the integral domain $D$, $D$ is a field.
