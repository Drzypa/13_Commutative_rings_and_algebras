\begin{document}
\begin{proof} Let $\smp_1,\ldots,\smp_k$ be all the primes of a Dedekind domain $R$. If $I$ is any ideal of $R$, then by the Weak Approximation Theorem we can choose $x\in R$ such that $\nu_{\smp_i}((x))=\nu_{\smp_i}(I)$ for all $i$ (where $\nu_{\smp}$ is the $\smp$-adic valuation). But since $R$ is Dedekind, ideals have unique factorization; since $(x)$ and $I$ have identical factorizations, we must have $(x)=I$ and $I$ is principal.
\end{proof}
