Let $R$ be a commutative ring and let $S$ be a non-empty multiplicative subset of $R$.\, Then the \PMlinkname{localisation}{Localization} of $R$ at $S$ gives the commutative ring \,$S^{-1}R$\, but, generally, it has no subring isomorphic to $R$.\, Formally, $S^{-1}R$ consists of all elements $\frac{a}{s}$ ($a \in R$, $s \in S$).\, Therefore, $S^{-1}R$ is called also a {\em ring of quotients} of $R$.\, If\, $0 \in S$, then\, 
$S^{-1}R = \{0\}$;\, we assume now that\, $0 \notin S$.

\begin{itemize}
\item The mapping \,$a \mapsto \frac{as}{s}$, where $s$ is any element of $S$, is well-defined and a homomorphism from $R$ to $S^{-1}R$. \,All elements of $S$ are mapped to units of $S^{-1}R$.
\item If, especially, $S$ contains no zero divisors of the ring $R$, then the above mapping is an isomorphism from $R$ to a certain subring of $S^{-1}R$, and we may think that\, $S^{-1}R \supseteq R$.\, In this case, the ring of fractions of $R$ is an extension ring of $R$; this concerns of course the case that $R$ is an integral domain.\, But if $R$ is a finite ring, then\, $S^{-1}R = R$,\, and no proper extension is obtained.
