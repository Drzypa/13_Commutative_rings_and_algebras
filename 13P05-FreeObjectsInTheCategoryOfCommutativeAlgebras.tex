Let $R$ be a commutative ring and let $\alg$ be the category of all commutative algebras over $R$ and algebra homomorphisms. This category together with the forgetful functor is a construct (i.e. it is a concrete category over the category of sets $\mathcal{SET}$). Therefore we can talk about free objects in $\alg$ (see \PMlinkname{this entry}{FreeObjectsInConcreteCategories2} for definitions).

\textbf{Theorem.} For any set $\X$ the polynomial algebra $R[\X]$ (see parent object) is a free object in $\alg$ with $\X$ being a basis. This means that for any commutative algebra $A$ and any function
$$f:\X\to A$$
there exists a unique algebra homomorphism $F:R[\X]\to A$ such that
$$F(x)=f(x)$$
for any $x\in \X$.

\textit{Proof.} Assume that $f:\X\to A$ is a function. If $W\in R[\X]$, then there are finite subsets $A_1,\ldots,A_n\subseteq \X$ (not necessarily disjoint) and natural numbers $n(x,i)$, $i=1,\ldots,n$ such that $W$ can be uniquely expressed as
$$W=\sum_{i=1}^n \bigg(\lambda_i\cdot\prod_{x\in A_i}x^{n(x,i)}\bigg)$$
with $\lambda_i\in R$. Define $F(W)$ by putting
$$F(W)=\sum_{i=1}^n \bigg(\lambda_i\cdot\prod_{x\in A_i}f(x)^{n(x,i)}\bigg).$$
Of course $F$ is well defined and obviously $F(x)=f(x)$. We leave as a simple exercise that $F$ is an algebra homomorphism.
The uniqueness of $F$ again follows from the explicit form of $W$. It is easily seen that $F(W)$ depends only on $F(x)$ for $x\in\X$. This completes the proof. $\square$

\textbf{Corollary 1.} If $\X$ is a set and $\Y\subseteq\X$, then the inclusion $i:\Y\to\X$ induces an algebra monomorphism
$$I:R[\Y]\to R[\X].$$
In particular we can treat $R[\Y]$ as a subalgebra of $R[\X]$.

\textit{Proof.} We have a well-defined function $i:\Y\to R[\X]$, $i(y)=y$. By the theorem we have an extension
$$I:R[\Y]\to R[\X]$$
such that $I(y)=y$. It remains to show, that $I$ is ,,1-1''. Indeed, assume that $I(W)=0$ for some polynomial $W\in R[\Y]$. But if we recall the expression of $W$ as in proof of the theorem and remember that $I$ is an algebra homomorphism, then it is easy to see that $I(y)=y$ implies that
$$I(W)=W.$$
In particular $W=0$, which completes the proof. $\square$

\textbf{Corollary 2.} If $A$ is an $R$-algebra, then there exists a set $\X$ such that
$$A\simeq R[\X]/I$$
for some ideal $I$.

\textit{Proof.} Let $\X=A$ as a set. Define
$$f:\X\to A$$
by $f(x)=x$. By the theorem we have an algebra homomorphism
$$F:R[\X]\to A$$
such that $F(x)=x$ for $x\in \X$. In particular $F$ is ,,onto'' and thus by the First Isomorphism Theorem for algebras we have
$$A\simeq R[\X]/\mathrm{Ker}F$$
which completes the proof. $\square$
