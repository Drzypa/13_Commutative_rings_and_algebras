\begin{document}
For a commutative ring $R$ having regular elements, we may form \,$T = S^{-1}R$, the {\em total ring of fractions} (quotients) of $R$, as the localization of $R$ at $S$, where $S$ is the set of all non-zero-divisors of $R$. \,Then, $T$ can be regarded as an extension ring of $R$ (similarly as the field of fractions of an integral domain is an extension ring). \,$T$ has the non-zero unity 1.
