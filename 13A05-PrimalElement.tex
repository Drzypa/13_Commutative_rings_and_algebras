An element $r$ in a commutative ring $R$ is called \emph{primal} if whenever $r\mid ab$, with $a,b\in R$, then there 
exist elements $s,t\in R$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $r=st$,
\item $s\mid a$ and $t\mid b$.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Lemma}.  In a commutative ring, an element that is both irreducible and primal is a prime element.
\begin{proof}
Suppose $a$ is irreducible and primal, and $a\mid bc$.  Since $a$ is primal, there is $x,y\in R$ such that $a=xy$, with $x\mid b$ and $y\mid c$.  Since $a$ is irreducible, either $x$ or $y$ is a unit.  If $x$ is a unit, with $z$ as its inverse, then $za=zxy=y$, so that $a\mid y$.  But $y\mid c$, we have that $a\mid c$.
\end{proof}
