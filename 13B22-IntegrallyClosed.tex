\begin{document}
A subring $R$ of a commutative ring $S$ is said to be {\em integrally closed} in $S$ if whenever $\theta \in S$ and $\theta$ is integral over $R$, then $\theta \in R$.

The integral closure of $R$ in $S$ is integrally closed in $S$.

An integral domain $R$ is said to be {\em integrally closed} (or {\em \PMlinkescapetext{normal}}) if it is integrally closed in its fraction field.
