\begin{document}
An ideal $Q$ in a commutative ring $R$ is a \emph{primary ideal} if for all elements $x,y\in R$, we have that if $xy\in Q$, then either $x\in Q$ or $y^n\in Q$ for some $n\in\mb{N}$.

This is clearly a generalization of the notion of a prime ideal, and (very) loosely mirrors the relationship in $\mb{Z}$ between prime numbers and prime powers.

It is clear that every prime ideal is primary.

\textbf{Example.}  Let $Q=(25)$ in $R=\mb{Z}$.  Suppose that $xy\in Q$ but $x\notin Q$.  Then $25|xy$, but 25 does not divide $x$.  Thus 5 must divide $y$, and thus some power of $y$ (namely, $y^2$), must be in $Q$.

The radical of a primary ideal is always a prime ideal.  If $P$ is the radical of the primary ideal $Q$, we say that $Q$ is \emph{$P$-primary}.

%If the radical of the primary ideal $Q$ is the prime ideal $P$, then $Q$ is said to be \emph{$P$-primary}.
