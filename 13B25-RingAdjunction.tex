\begin{document}
Let $R$ be a commutative ring and $E$ an extension ring of it.\, If\, $\alpha \in E$\, and commutes with all elements of $R$, then the smallest subring of $E$ containing $R$ and $\alpha$ is denoted by $R[\alpha]$.\, We say that $R[\alpha]$ is obtained from $R$ by adjoining  $\alpha$ to $R$ via {\em ring adjunction}. 

By the \PMlinkescapetext{Theorem 1} about ``evaluation 
homomorphism'', 
     $$R[\alpha] = \{f(\alpha)\mid \, f(X)\in R[X]\},$$
where $R[X]$ is the polynomial ring in one indeterminate over 
$R$.\, Therefore, $R[\alpha]$ consists of all expressions which 
can be formed of $\alpha$ and elements of the ring $R$ by using 
additions, subtractions and multiplications.

\textbf{Examples:}\, The polynomial rings $R[X]$, the ring $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ of the Gaussian integers, the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\frac{-1+i\sqrt{3}}{2}]$ of Eisenstein integers.
