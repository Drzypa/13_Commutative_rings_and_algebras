A divisor theory \,$\mathcal{O}^* \to \mathfrak{D}$\, of an integral domain $\mathcal{O}$ determines via its prime divisors a certain set $N$ of exponent valuations on the quotient field of $\mathcal{O}$.\, Assume to be known this set of \PMlinkname{exponents}{ExponentValuation2} $\nu_{\mathfrak{p}}$ corresponding the prime divisors $\mathfrak{p}$.\, There is a bijective correspondence between the elements of $N$ and of the set of all prime divisors.\, The set of the prime divisors determines completely the \PMlinkescapetext{structure} of the free monoid $\mathfrak{D}$ of all divisors in question.  The homomorphism \,$\mathcal{O}^* \to \mathfrak{D}$\, is then defined by the condition
\begin{align}
\alpha\; \mapsto\; \prod_i\mathfrak{p_i}^{\nu_{\mathfrak{p}_i}(\alpha)} = (\alpha),Â´
\end{align}
since for any element $\alpha$ of $\mathcal{O}^*$ there exists only a finite number of exponents $\nu_{\mathfrak{p}_i}$ which do not vanish on $\alpha$ (corresponding the different prime divisor \PMlinkname{factors}{DivisibilityInRings} of the principal divisor $(\alpha)$).\\

One can take the concept of exponent as foundation for divisor theory:\\

\textbf{Theorem.}\, Let $\mathcal{O}$ be an integral domain with quotient field $K$ and $N$ a given set of \PMlinkname{exponents}{ExponentValuation2} of $K$.\, The exponents in $N$ determine, as in (1), a divisor theory of $\mathcal{O}$ iff the following three conditions are in \PMlinkescapetext{force}:
\begin{itemize}
\item For every\, $\alpha \in \mathcal{O}$\, there is at most a finite number of exponents\, $\nu \in N$\, such that\, $\nu(\alpha) \neq 0$.
\item An element\, $\alpha \in K$\, belongs to $\mathcal{O}$ if and only if\, $\nu(\alpha) \geqq 0$\, for each\, 
$\nu \in N$.
\item For any finite set \,$\nu_1,\,\ldots,\,\nu_n$\, of distinct exponents in $N$ and for the arbitrary set\, $k_1,\,\ldots,\,k_n$ of non-negative integers, there exists an element $\alpha$ of $\mathcal{O}$ such that
$$\nu_1(\alpha) = k_1,\,\;\ldots,\,\;\nu_n(\alpha) = k_n.$$
\end{itemize}

For the proof of the theorem, we mention only how to construct the divisors when we have the exponent set $N$ fulfilling the three conditions of the theorem.\, We choose a commutative monoid $\mathfrak{D}$ that allows unique prime factorisation and that may be mapped bijectively onto $N$.\, The exponent in $N$ which corresponds to arbitrary prime element $\mathfrak{p}$ is denoted by $\nu_\mathfrak{p}$.\, Then we obtain the homomorphism
$$\alpha \mapsto \prod_\nu \mathfrak{p}^{\nu_\mathfrak{p}(\alpha)} := (\alpha)$$
which can be seen to satisfy all required properties for a divisor theory\, $\mathcal{O}^* \to \mathfrak{D}$.
