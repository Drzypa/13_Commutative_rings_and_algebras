\textbf{Definition.}\, Let $R$ be a commutative ring having a regular element and let $T$ be the total ring of fractions of $R$.\, An \PMlinkname{$R$-submodule}{Submodule} $\mathfrak{a}$ of $T$ is called {\em fractional ideal} of $R$, provided that there exists a regular element $d$ of $R$ such that\, $\mathfrak{a}d \subseteq R$.\, If a fractional ideal is contained in $R$, it is a usual ideal of $R$, and we can call it an {\em integral ideal} of $R$. \\

Note that a fractional ideal of $R$ is not necessarily a subring of $T$.\, The set of all fractional ideals of $R$ form under the multiplication an commutative semigroup with identity element\, $R' = R\!+\!\mathbb{Z}e$,\, where $e$ is the unity of $T$.

An ideal $\mathfrak{a}$ (\PMlinkescapetext{integral} or fractional) of $R$ is called {\em invertible}, if there exists another ideal $\mathfrak{a}^{-1}$ of $R$ such that\, $\mathfrak{aa}^{-1} = R'$.\, It is not hard to show that any invertible ideal $\mathfrak{a}$ is finitely generated and \PMlinkname{regular}{RegularIdeal}, moreover that the {\em inverse ideal} $\mathfrak{a}^{-1}$ is uniquely determined (see the entry ``\PMlinkname{invertible ideal is finitely generated}{InvertibleIdealIsFinitelyGenerated}'') and may be generated by the \PMlinkname{same amount of generators}{GeneratorsOfInverseIdeal} as $\mathfrak{a}$.

The set of all invertible fractional ideals of $R$ forms an Abelian group under the multiplication.\, This group has a normal subgroup consisting of all regular principal fractional ideals; the corresponding factor group is called the \PMlinkescapetext{{\em class group}} of the ring $R$. \\

\textbf{Note.}\, In the special case that the ring $R$ has a unity 1, $R$ itself is the principal ideal (1), being the identity element of the semigroup of fractional ideals and the group of invertible fractional ideals.\, It is called the {\em unit ideal}.\, The unit ideal is the only integral ideal containing units of the ring.
