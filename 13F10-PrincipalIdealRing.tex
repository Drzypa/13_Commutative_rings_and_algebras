\begin{document}
A commutative ring $R$ in which all ideals are \PMlinkname{principal}{PrincipalIdeal}, \PMlinkname{i.e.}{Ie} \PMlinkname{generated by}{IdealGeneratedBy} a single ring element, is called a {\em principal ideal ring}.\, If $R$ is also an integral domain, it is a principal ideal domain.

Some well-known principal ideal rings are the ring $\mathbb{Z}$ of integers, its factor rings $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$, and any polynomial ring over a field.
