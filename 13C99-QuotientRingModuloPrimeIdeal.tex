\textbf{Theorem.}  Let $R$ be a commutative ring with non-zero unity 1 and $\mathfrak{p}$ an ideal of $R$.  The quotient ring $R/\mathfrak{p}$ is an integral domain if and only if $\mathfrak{p}$ is a prime ideal.\\

{\em Proof.} $1^{\underline{o}}$.  First, let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a prime ideal of $R$.  Then $R/\mathfrak{p}$ is of course a commutative ring and has the unity $1+\mathfrak{p}$.  If the product\, $(r+\mathfrak{p})(s+\mathfrak{p})$ of two residue classes vanishes, i.e. equals $\mathfrak{p}$, then we have\, $rs+\mathfrak{p}= \mathfrak{p}$,\, and therefore $rs$ must belong to $\mathfrak{p}$.  Since $\mathfrak{p}$ is \PMlinkescapetext{prime}, either $r$ or $s$ belongs to $\mathfrak{p}$, i.e.\, $r+\mathfrak{p}= \mathfrak{p}$\, or\, $s+\mathfrak{p}= \mathfrak{p}$.\, Accordingly, 
$R/\mathfrak{p}$ has no zero divisors and is an integral domain. 

$2^{\underline{o}}$.  Conversely, let $R/\mathfrak{p}$ be an integral domain and let the product $rs$ of two elements of $R$ belong to $\mathfrak{p}$.  It follows that\, $(r+\mathfrak{p})(s+\mathfrak{p}) = rs+\mathfrak{p} = \mathfrak{p}$.  Since $R/\mathfrak{p}$ has no zero divisors,\, $r+\mathfrak{p} = \mathfrak{p}$\, or\, $s+\mathfrak{p} =\mathfrak{p} $.  Thus, $r$ or $s$ belongs to $\mathfrak{p}$, i.e. $\mathfrak{p}$ is a prime ideal.
