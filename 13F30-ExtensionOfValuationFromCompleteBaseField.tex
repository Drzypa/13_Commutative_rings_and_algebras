Here the valuations are of rank one, and it may be supposed that the values are real numbers. 

\begin{itemize}
 \item Assume a finite field extension $K/k$ and a valuation of $K$. \,If the base field is \PMlinkname{complete}{Complete} with regard to this valuation, so is also the extension field.
 \item If $K/k$ is an algebraic field extension and if the base field $k$ is \PMlinkname{complete}{Complete} with regard to its valuation \,$|\cdot|$, \, then this valuation has one and only one extension to the field $K$. \,This extension is determined by
  $$|\alpha| = \sqrt[n]{|N(\alpha)|}\quad (\alpha \in K),$$
where $N(\alpha)$ is the norm of the element $\alpha$ in the simple field extension $k(\alpha)/k$ and $n$ is the degree of this field extension.
\end{itemize}

These theorems concern also Archimedean valuations.
