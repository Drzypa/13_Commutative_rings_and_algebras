An \PMlinkname{algebra}{Algebra} $A$ is said to be \PMlinkescapephrase{order} {\em without order} if it is commutative and \\for each $a \in A$, there exists $b \in A$ such that $ab \ne 0$.\\

The phrase algebra without order seems first in the book ``Multipliers of Banach algebras'' by Ronald Larsen. In noncommutative case, the concept is divied into two parts -- without left/right order. However, in the noncommutative case, it is defined in terms of the injectivity of the left (right) regular representation given by $x \in A \mapsto L_x \in L(A)$. 

Note that for an algebra $A$ and an element $x \in A$, $L_x : A \to A$ is the map defined by $L_x(y) = xy$. Then $L_x$ is a linear operator on $A$. It is easy to see that $A$ is without left order if and only if the map $x \in A \mapsto L_x \in L(A)$ is one-one; equivalently, the left ideal $\{x \in A : x \in A\} = \{0\}$. This ideal is is called the left annihilator of $A$. 

Every commutative algebra with identity is without order.\\

Example: $\mathbb{R}^2$ with multiplication defined by $(x_1,x_2) * (y_1,y_2) = (x_1y_1,0)$, ($(x_1,x_2), (y_1,y_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2$) is not an algebra without order as multiplication of (0,1) with any other element gives (0,0).
