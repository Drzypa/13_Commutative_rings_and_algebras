\begin{document}
Let $R$ be a ring.  Then $R$ is also an algebra over the ring of integers if we define the action of $\mathbb{Z}$ on $R$ by the following rules:
 \[0 \cdot x = 0\]
 \[(n + 1) \cdot x = n \cdot x + x\]
 \[(-n) \cdot x = -(n \cdot x)\]
In other words, the action of a positive integer $n$ on $x$ is to add $x$ to itself $n$ times and the action of a negative integer $n$ on $x$ is to subtract $x$ to itself $n$ times.
